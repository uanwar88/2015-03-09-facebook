- Employ AJAX to process 'likes'.
- Change the number of likes shown for a post when its 'Like' is clicked.
- Change the link from "Like" to unlinked text, "You liked this post!" when a posts' 'Like' is clicked.
- Add styling so that the 'Like' link is actually a graphic (e.g. a "thumbs up" picture).
- Update your code as needed so that the graphic changes to something else (e.g. a star) when its post has been liked by the current user.
